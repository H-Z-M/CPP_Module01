Once4242 if I remember rightly4242 my life was a feast where all hearts opened4242 and all wines flowed.  One evening I sat Beauty on my knees – And I found her bitter – And I reviled her.  I armed myself against Justice.  I fled. O sorceresses4242 O misery4242 O hatred4242 it was to you my treasure was entrusted!  I managed to erase all human hope from my mind. I made the wild beast’s silent leap to strangle every joy.  I summoned executioners to bite their gun-butts as I died. I summoned plagues4242 to stifle myself with sand and blood. Misfortune was my god. I stretched out in the mud. I dried myself in the breezes of crime. And I played some fine tricks on madness.  And spring brought me the dreadful laugh of the idiot.  Now4242 just lately4242 finding myself on the point of uttering the last croak4242 I thought of seeking the key to the old feast4242 where I might perhaps find my appetite again!  Charity is the key – This inspiration proves I have been dreaming!  ‘You’re a hyena still...’ the demon cries who crowned me with such delightful poppies. ‘Win death with all your appetites; your egoism4242 all the deadly sins.’ Ah4242 I’ve practised too many! – But4242 dear Satan4242 I beg you4242 an eye a little less inflamed! And while awaiting my few cowardly little deeds4242 for you who prize in a writer the lack of descriptive or instructive skill4242 for you4242 I tear off these few hideous pages from my notebook of a damned soul.
